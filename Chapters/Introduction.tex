Cancer is a very challenging family of diseases which has been at the forefront of biological and biomedical research for many years now. It has been a leading cause of death in Germany and all over the world for many years\addref[leading cause of death]. Still, no profound understanding or comprehensive success in cancer therapy has been achieved yet, as most current treatments remain highly dangerous, invasive, or their success rate very uncertain\addref[danger+uncertainty of treatments]. That is also caused by the significant heterogenetiy that can be found in cancer: cancer cells can differ in multiple aspects between different patients (\textit{inter-patient heterogeneity}), between different tumours of the same patient (\textit{inter-tumour heterogeneity}) or even between individual cells within the same tumour (\textit{intra-tumour heterogeneity}).\addref[heterogeneity]
One of the problems caused by this heterogeneity is that it makes the way a certain tumour or patient would react to a specific cancer drug very unpredictable. A drug which is very effective on one patient might not do anything for another patient with the same kind of tumour.\rewrite[]
Personalized cancer therapy is one of the main goals of cancer research, since it would allow medical practitioners to adminster drugs with a higher probability of success and a lower chance of unwanted side effects.\citep{meric2012overcoming}\\
