The first of these hallmarks is that cancer cells are self-sufficient in growth signals. That means that they don't require signals (by way of hormones, e.g.) to initiate cell growth; they either produce these signals themselves (through so-called \textit{autocrine signaling}), activate the growth pathway (that would usually be activated by the previously mentioned signals), or destroy the negative feedback loops in place to prevent excessive growth through these signals.\\
The second and third hallmarks are that cancer cells tend to be insensitive to anti-growth signals and apoptosis. Similarly to the previous hallmark, the cancer cell circumvents the typical mechanisms meant to avoid uncontrolled growth and abnormal proliferation of cells; or, in the case of apoptosis, the most drastic and last line of defense against abnormally proliferating cells, the induced cell death.\\
The next two hallmarks are related to the actual uncontrolled growth and multiplication of tumors and cancer cells. They are, in fact, the ability of cancer cells to replicate an unlimited number of times (whereas regular cells die after a certain number of divisions), as well as the sustained formation of new blood vessels (\textit{angiogenesis}) to ensure the needed supply of oxygen and nutrients for the growth of a tumor.\\
Finally, the last hallmark of cancer is the ability of cancer cells to break away from their original site or organ of origin to invade other surrounding tissue and spread all across the body in a process called \textit{metastasis}. This is the most known consequence of cancer, and extremely dangerous for the health and survival of the patient, as it can lead to failure in any organ that it might reach, and metastatic cancer (also known as \textit{Stage IV}) can currently not be treated.
